## Ever wanted to join someone instantly on Roblox?
This has allowed for me to get into people's servers *way faster*. I'm sharing a more polished version of that program.

## How does RoSniper work?
RoSniper uses Roblox's Presence API to check if a given user is online. If so, then it will attempt to join that user.</br>
**DISCLAIMER: You can ONLY join users that let you join them (ex: you're friended/following them, or the user being sniped has their joins on). This is NOT a stream-sniping exploit, and won't be advertised as one.**

## Current Features:
- Snipe users you recently tried to join for easier access to them
- Customize your experience through commands or by modifying config.json
- Check for multiple user statuses at the same time
- Decline the first server which is detected, just in case it's already full
- Monitor a set of users without join-sniping them
- Set a ZSH alias (macOS only) for easier access to RoSniper from the terminal
- Build RoSniper into an executable which anyone can run

## How do I build this from source?
There is a build script in ./build/ that can be used to build RoSniper for macOS and Windows.</br>
This creates an executable that anyone (even if they don't have Python) can run.</br>
Clone this repository and build RoSniper, or just run the source code itself.</br>

Tested on all macOS versions 15.0-26.1b1 with Python 3.14.x! It likely also works on previous versions.</br>
ðŸŽ‰ Windows support has been added in v1.0.0! It is recommended to use Windows 11. ðŸŽ‰

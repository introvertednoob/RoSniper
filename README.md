## Ever wanted to join someone instantly on Roblox? (I have!)
This has allowed for me to get into people's servers *way faster*. It's helped me get certain items that require you to join famous people. And I'm sharing a (hopefully more polished) version of that program.

## Current Features:
- Snipe users you recently tried to join for easier access to them
- Most of the program is customizable using commands or by modifying config.json
- Check for multiple user statuses at the same time

## How does RoSniper work?
RoSniper uses Roblox's Presence API to check if a given user is online. If so, then it will attempt to join that user.</br>
**NOTE: You can ONLY join users that let you join them (ex: you're friended/following them, or the user being sniped has their joins on). This is NOT a stream-sniping exploit.**

## How do I build this from source?
There is a build script in ./build/ that can be used to build RoSniper for macOS and Windows.</br>
This creates an executable that anyone (even if they don't have Python) can run.</br>
Clone this repository and build RoSniper, or just run the source code itself.</br>

Tested on all macOS versions 15.0-26.0b1 with Python 3.13-3.13.4! It likely also works on previous versions.</br>
🎉 Windows support has been added in v1.0.0! It is recommended to use Windows 11. 🎉

A simple Roblox stream sniper :)<br>
<br>
RoSniper uses Roblox's Presence API to check if a given user is online. If so, then it will attempt to join that user.<br>
**DISCLAIMER: You can ONLY join users that let you join them (ex: you're friended/following them, or the user being sniped has their joins on). RoSniper is NOT a RoSearcher clone or an injectable exploit.**<br>
Tested on macOS 15+ and Python 3.13+, but RoSniper likely also works on previous versions of these programs/operating systems.

## Current Features:
- Snipe users you recently tried to join for easier access
- Switch between multiple accounts with ease
- Check for multiple user statuses at the same time
- Monitor a set of users without join-sniping them
- Decline the first server which is detected, just in case it's already full
- Customize your experience through commands or by modifying config.json
- Set a ZSH alias (macOS only) for easier access to RoSniper from the terminal
- Build RoSniper into an executable which anyone can run
- Progressive cookie validation for much faster startup times, especially with lots of accounts (coming soon™, planned for v2.0.0)

## How do I build this from source?
There is a build script in ./build/ that can be used to build RoSniper for macOS and Windows.<br>
This creates an executable that anyone (even if they don't have Python) can run.<br>
Clone this repository and build RoSniper, or just run the source code itself.<br>

## Donations
Donations will never be required to use any features of RoSniper.<br>
If you enjoy using RoSniper, consider running `/donate ROBUX_AMOUNT` in RoSniper.

# Streamer Showcase
I have stream-sniped multiple streamers using RoSniper!<br>
So can you, as long as the streamer has their joins on. **Again, this program only works on people you are able to join NORMALLY.**<br>

### For example, I was the only other person in KreekCraft's game on a Dandy's World stream with 4k+ people.<br>

### I also managed to get into a Pls Donate! server with KreekCraft.<br>

### Less notably, I joined lolcat in a Squid Game clone.<br>

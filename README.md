# RoSniper
RoSniper uses Roblox's Presence API to check if a given user is online. If so, then it will attempt to join that user.</br>
**DISCLAIMER: You can ONLY join users that let you join them (ex: you're friended/following them, or the user being sniped has their joins on). This is NOT a stream-sniping exploit, and won't be advertised as one.**

## Current Features:
- Snipe users you recently tried to join for easier access to them
- Customize your experience through commands or by modifying config.json
- Check for multiple user statuses at the same time
- Decline the first server which is detected, just in case it's already full
- Monitor a set of users without join-sniping them
- Set a ZSH alias (macOS only) for easier access to RoSniper from the terminal
- Build RoSniper into an executable which anyone can run

## How do I build this from source?
There is a build script in ./build/ that can be used to build RoSniper for macOS and Windows.</br>
This creates an executable that anyone (even if they don't have Python) can run.</br>
Clone this repository and build RoSniper, or just run the source code itself.</br>

Tested on all macOS versions 15.0-26.x with Python 3.14.x! It likely also works on previous versions.</br>
ðŸŽ‰ Windows support has been added in v1.0.0! It is recommended to use Windows 11. ðŸŽ‰

## Donations
Donations will never be required to use any features of RoSniper.</br>
If you seriously love and/or enjoy the project, consider running `/donate ROBUX_AMOUNT` in RoSniper.

# Streamer Showcase
I have join-sniped multiple streamers using RoSniper!</br>
So can you, as long as the streamer has their joins on. **Again, this program only works on people you are ALLOWED to join.**</br>

### For example, I was the only other person in KreekCraft's game on a Dandy's World stream.</br>

### I also managed to get into a Pls Donate server with KreekCraft.</br>

### Less notably, I joined lolcat in a Squid Game clone.</br>
